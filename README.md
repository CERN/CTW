# Craft The Web
"Craft The Web" (CTW) is a collaborative gaming environment that lets players recreate the World Wide Web together.
In the process, players will learn about what makes the Web function, as well as about the ideas and major inventions that assisted in its creation.

CTW aims to cater for different types of gameplay, ranging from exploration to achievements.

CTW is written for Minetest, an extensible open-source crafting game environment.
